                                an input unit. It supplied information and results of computation to the outside world.

                                    <p>Ever wonder how the Internet works? You won’t believe how simple it is. The Internet is a global computer network for communication – actually nothing more than a basic computer network. The Internet simply moves data from one place to another, so that we can chat, browse and share.</p>
<p>Data moves over the Internet in a manner called “packet switching.” What packet switching basically does is send your data in separate pieces – each tagged with your intended destination. Once all of the pieces reach their target, they are reassembled into – voila! – your email. Packets flow by many routes, each determined by the quickest and most efficient at the time you send your email.</p>
<p>If you had a permanent connection to the intended destination or if your email traveled as a whole instead of in pieces, an entire portion of the network would be blocked every time you sent a message. With packet switching, many people can use the Internet at the same time.</p>
<p>There are millions upon millions of servers on the Internet. Servers store information. There are file servers, mail servers and web servers. The Internet is also made up of routers. Routers simply make connections between different systems. For instance, at work or school, where several computers are networked, you are connected to one router – a single point of entry for the Internet.</p>

        <ol> If we compare the characteristics of these two laptops,
        I would definitely recommend to Choose Apple MacBook Pro 16 (2021).
        It has many advantages and benefits, such as:</ol>
        <ol>Higher refresh rate: 120 vs 60 Hz in Dell;</ol>
        <ol>The video card shows an average of 32-44% more FPS;</ol> 
        <ol>Comes with a 14Wh larger battery (100 and 86Wh);</ol>  
        <ol>Best quality webcam video recording. Amazing quality audio when playing music or video with Dolby Atmos on built-in speakers.
            And studio-quality three-mic array with high signal-to-noise ratio and directional beamforming.</ol>    
        <ol>But the biggest disadvantage of the MacBook is the price.</ol>  
        <ol>And if the price is the big problem, so Dell XPS 15 9510 (2021) is a good choice too.
            And he also has a number of advantages, such as:</ol>   
        <ol>Slightly lighter - weighs 180 grams less (1.92 and 2.1 kg);</ol>   
        <ol>Thinner bezels - 3% more screen real estate;</ol>   
        <ol>Touch screen;</ol>   
        <ol>Upgradeable RAM (up to 64 GB) and SSD;</ol>   
        <ol>More compact - has a 10% smaller body area (793 and 882 cm 2 ).</ol>
