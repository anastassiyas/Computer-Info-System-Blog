            <h3>Computer security threats are relentlessly inventive. Masters of disguise 
                and manipulation, these threats constantly evolve to find new ways to annoy, 
                steal and harm. Arm yourself with information and resources to safeguard 
                against complex and growing computer security threats and stay safe online.</h3>
                                    
            <h4  style="background-color: rgb(53, 26, 207);"><strong><i>Computer Viruses</i></strong></h4>
            <ol>Perhaps the most well-known computer security threat, a computer virus is a program 
                written to alter the way a computer operates, without the permission or knowledge of 
                the user. A virus replicates and executes itself, usually doing damage to your computer in the process.</ol> 
            <ol>Carefully evaluating free software, downloads from peer-to-peer file sharing sites, 
                and emails from unknown senders are crucial to avoiding viruses. Most web browsers 
                today have security settings which can be ramped up for optimum defense against online threats. 
                But, as we'll say again and again in this post, the single most-effective way of fending off viruses 
                is up-to-date antivirus software from a reputable provider. </ol>

            <h4 style="background-color: rgb(53, 26, 207);"><strong><i>Spyware Threats</i></strong></h4>
        
            <ol>A serious computer security threat, spyware is any program that monitors your online activities or 
                installs programs without your consent for profit or to capture personal information. 
                Weâ€™ve amassed a wealth of knowledge that will help you combat spyware threats and stay safe online.                                  </ol>
            <ol>While many users won't want to hear it, reading terms and conditions is a good way to build an 
                understanding of how your activity is tracked online. And of course, if a company you don't 
                recognize is advertising for a deal that seems too good to be true, be sure you have an internet 
                security solution in place and click with caution.</ol>

            <h4 style="background-color: rgb(53, 26, 207);"><strong><i>Phishing</i></strong></h4>
        
            <ol>Masquerading as a trustworthy person or business, phishers attempt to steal sensitive financial 
                or personal information through fraudulent email or instant messages. Phishing attacks are some 
                of the most successful methods for cybercriminals looking to pull off a data breach. 
                Antivirus solutions with identity theft protection can be "taught" to recognize phishing 
                threats in fractions of a second. </ol>

            <h4 style="background-color: rgb(53, 26, 207);"><strong><i>Hackers and Predators</i></strong></h4>
        
            <ol>People, not computers, create computer security threats and malware. Hackers and predators are 
                programmers who victimize others for their own gain by breaking into computer systems to steal, 
                change, or destroy information as a form of cyber-terrorism. These online predators can compromise 
                credit card information, lock you out of your data, and steal your identity. As you may have guessed, 
                online security tools with identity theft protection are one of the most effective ways to protect 
                yourself from this brand of cybercriminal.</ol>
