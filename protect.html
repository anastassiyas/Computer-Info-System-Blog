                                deleting your important files, or even creating viruses. By making changes
                                to your computer to prevent unauthorized access, you are also protecting your
                                personal privacy. Here are some steps to take to properly secure your computer
                                and prevent others from accessing your files on both the Windows and Macintosh
                                operating systems.</h3>

                            <ol>Enable password protection on your computer if it is not already set up. Make sure you
                                are using a personal password you have chosen versus the default password.</ol>
                            <ol>When creating your password, be sure to incorporate numbers or special characters
                                to make it difficult for others to guess.</ol>
                            <ol>Change your password often, at least every 2 months.</ol>
                            <ol>Do not leave your password written down in a place where others can easily find it.</ol>
