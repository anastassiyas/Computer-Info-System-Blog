                            <h3>The OSI models specifies how information is transmitted from a
                                network device like a router to its destination through a physical
                                medium and how it interacts with the application. In other words,
                                it provides a standard for different systems to communicate with each other.</h3>
                            <h4><strong><i>Layer 1:</i><br>Physical Layer:</strong></h4>

                            <ol>At the lowest layer of the OSI reference model, the physical layer is responsible
                                for transmitting unstructured data bits across the network between the physical layers
                                of the sending and receiving devices. In other words,
                                it takes care of the transmission of raw bit streams.</ol>
                            <ol> The physical layer may include physical resources like cables, modems, network adapters, and hubs, etc.</ol>
                            

                        </div>
                        <h4><strong><i>Layer 2:</i><br>Data Link Layer</strong></h4>

                    <ol>The data link layer corrects any errors that may have occurred at the physical layer. 
                        It ensures that any data transfer is error-free between nodes over the physical layer.
                        It is responsible for reliable transmission of data frames between connected nodes.
                        The data is packaged into frames here and transferred node-to-node. The data layer has the following sub-layers</ol>
                    <ol><strong>Media Access Control (MAC):</strong> The MAC address layer is responsible for flow control and multiplexing devices transmissions over the network.</ol>
                    <ol><strong>link control (LLC):</strong> The LLC layer provides error control and flow control over the physical medium and identifies line protocols.</ol>

                    <br>


                    <div class="flex2">
                        <h4><strong><i>Layer 3:</i><br>Network Layer</strong></h4>

                        <ol>The network layer receives frames from the data link layer and delivers them to the intended destination
                            based on the addresses inside the frame. It also handles packet routing. The network layer locates destinations
                            using logical addresses like the IP. Routers are a crucial component at this layer as they route information to where it needs to go between different networks.

                            The main functions of the Network layer are:</ol>
                        <ol><strong>Routing:</strong>strong The network layer protocols determine which routes from source to destination.</ol>
                        <ol><strong>Logical Addressing:</strong></ol>

                    </div>
                    <h4><strong><i>Layer 4:</i><br>Transport Layer</strong></h4>

                        <ol>The transport layer is responsible for <strong>delivering, error checking, flow control, and sequencing data packets.</strong>
                            It regulates the sequencing, size, and transfer of data between systems and hosts. It gets the data from the session
                            layer and breaks it into transportable segments.</ol>
                        <ol>Two examples of the Transport Layer are <i> UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</i> and <i>(Transmission Control Protocol)</i>
                             that is build on top of the Internet Protocol (IP model), which work at layer 3.

                        </ol>

                        <h4><strong><i>Layer 5:</i><br>Session Layer</strong></h4>

                        <ol>The session layer will create communication channels, called <strong>sessions</strong>,
                            between different devices. This layer is responsible for opening those sessions and 
                            ensuring that they’re functional during data transfer.</ol>
                        <ol>In other words, the session layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating
                            communication sessions with the lower layers with the presentation and application layer.
                            It is also responsible for authentication and reconnections, and it can set checkpoints during a data transfer—if.
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <h4><strong><i>Layer 6:</i><br>Presentation Layer</strong></h4>

                        <ol>The presentation layer is responsible for ensuring that the data is <strong>understandable for the end system</strong> 
                            or useful for later stages. It translates or formats data based on the application’s syntax or semantics.
                            It also manages any encryption or decryption required by the application layer. It is also called the syntax layer.</ol>

                        <h4><strong><i>Layer 7:</i><br>Application Layer                      
                            </strong></h4>

                        <ol>The application layer is where the user directly interacts with a software application, 
                            so it is <strong>closest to the end user</strong>. When the user wants to transmit files or pictures,
                            this layer interacts with the application communicating with the network. The application layer identifies resources,
                             communication partners, and synchronizes communication.</ol>

                        <ol>Other functions of the application layer are the Network Virtual Terminal and FTAM-File transfer access, 
                            and mail/directory services. The protocol used depends on the information the user wants to send. 
                            Some common protocols include:</ol>

                        <ol>POP3 or SMTP for emails</ol>
                        <ol>FTP for emails</ol>
                        <ol>Telnet for controlling remote devices</ol>
                        <ol><i>Examples of communications that use Layer 7 are web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

                    <ol>The OSI model has a number of advantages, including the following:</ol>

                    <ul>It's considered a standard model in computer networking.</ul>
                    <ul>The model supports connectionless, as well as connection-oriented, services.
                     Users can take advantage of connectionless services when they need faster data transmissions
                    over the internet and the connection-oriented model when they're looking for reliability.
                    <ul>It has the flexibility to adapt to many protocols.</ul>
                    <ul>The model is more adaptable and secure than having all services bundled in one layer.</ul>
